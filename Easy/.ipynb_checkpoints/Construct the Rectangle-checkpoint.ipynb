    "# For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. \n",
    "# So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, \n",
    "# whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.\n",
    "# You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Input: 4\n",
    "# Output: [2, 2]\n",
    "# Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. \n",
    "# But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2].\n",
